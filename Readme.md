# MP2 Design Document

My inspiration for this level was based on parkour games. I really enjoy parkour or "Obby" games so I wanted to design something like that. I decided to make a level that would take you across the map and have you do "parkour" along the way. I wanted this game to be fun but also a bit difficult, which it was even for me. I liked the incorporation of the pursuer and mortar enemy so at first I struggled with thinking of a new enemy to make. I finally decided to make a sort of "moving" enemy. my collectables are a robotic car and my health packs are flowers. I was again inspired by parkour which has moving obstacles to avoid. So my last enemy is a moving obstacle you either have to avoid or eliminate. I overall had really fun making this game and really learned alot from the challenges I faced.
